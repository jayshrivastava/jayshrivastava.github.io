I'm a recent Waterloo ECE grad living in New York! 🗽 I'm currently working on 
on [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), a distributed SQL database written in Go.

<br>
I enjoy designing and scaling distributed systems and programming with low-level languages Go and Rust.

Some of my interests basketball 🏀, chess ♖, poker 🃏, and fitness 🏋️.
