I'm a recent grad from Waterloo Computer Engineering living in New York! 🗽 I'm currently working on 
strongly consistent databases at [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach).

In the past, I have worked on distributed systems, databases, compilers, and web apps. 
I particularly enjoy systems engineering and programming for performance.

I'm also into pc gaming, fitness, and basketball 🏀
