I am a Waterloo Computer Engineering student and 5x software engineering intern looking for a final internship for my senior year. In the past, I have worked in the areas of fullstack development, distributed systems, databases,
cloud infrastructure, and data engineering. I particularly enjoy systems engineering and programming for performance.

<br>
I recently finished an internship working on [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), a distributed,
cloud-native, SQL database written in Go. Previously, I worked on real-time ad auctions on Shopify's
[App Store Ads]
(https://shopify.dev/concepts/app-store/advertising) team.

I'm also into gaming, running, basketball, playing the piano, and cooking.`
